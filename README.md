# TwoThousandFourtyEight
This project aims to implement the famous game [2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)) in purescript. It may (~~will~~) contain design errors and other quirks, as this is just made to increase my functional programming skills.

## Acknowledgments
My work is highly inspired by the blog post [Implementing the game 2048 in less than 90 lines of Haskell](http://gregorulm.com/2048-in-90-lines-haskell/) by Gregor Ulm.
